# Visualization-Tool-for-Diversity-Showcase
1)Problem: It can be difficult to visualize the diversity of women's contributions across Wikipedia.

2)Solution: To build a data visualization tool that showcases the breadth of women's contributions. This tool could categorize contributions by field, historical period, and other factors, allowing users to explore this data interactively.

3)Challenges: Underrepresentation of Women: Women's contributions on Wikipedia often face underrepresentation and lack of visibility, hindering the recognition of their achievements across various fields.

--Complexity in Data Understanding: The vastness of Wikipedia data makes it challenging for users to comprehend the extent and diversity of women's contributions, necessitating a tool for simplified exploration.

--Addressing Gender Gaps: The project addresses the existing gender gaps in online content by creating a visualization tool that showcases and categorizes women's contributions, encouraging a more equitable representation on the platform.

4)Tech Stack Used: --Wiki Dat: aWiki Data is a free and collaborative knowledge base hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. It serves as a central repository of structured data to be used by Wikipedia.

--SPARQL Queries via Wiki data Query Services-  SPARQL queries are crafted and executed using Wiki data Query Services to extract relevant data on women's contributions from Wiki data, providing a structured approach to obtaining information for further analysis.

--Power BI â€“Power BI is employed as the primary visualization tool, creating interactive dashboards that offer a user-friendly interface for exploring and understanding the diverse contributions of women on Wikipedia.

5)Conclusion - In conclusion, our project represents a significant step towards addressing the underrepresentation of women's contributions on Wikipedia. By developing an interactive data visualization tool that categorizes these contributions based on fields and historical periods, we aim to bring attention to the diverse roles women have played in shaping online knowledge. As we look to the future, we envision further enhancements and increased collaboration to  improve and expand the impact of our project.
